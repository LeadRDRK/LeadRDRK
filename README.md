## üë§ who
Hi there. You can call me Lead.

I'm a programmer/artist/game developer. Currently I'm still a student, so all of my works are just made for fun. My mission here on GitHub is to share my works with everyone, completely free and open source.
## üñ•Ô∏è works
I don't have anything really interesting to show you yet, but here are some of my (less interesting) current and past works:
- [ZPack](https://github.com/LeadRDRK/ZPack): Archive file format and library with extremely fast compression. This was originally made for use with my own games.
- [wine-rpc](https://github.com/LeadRDRK/wine-rpc): Program that shows your current running Wine application as a Discord RPC status. This is more or less a gimmick...
- [AsciiVid](https://github.com/LeadRDRK/AsciiVid): ASCII video player/codec. I made this in only a few days... it was not thought out really well. *But it works.*
